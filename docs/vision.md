Our platform concerns two stages:

First, the attendee answers a survey with personal information such as his/her interests or preferences. Based on this information, a clustering algorithm suggests lectures that match those interests and the attendee is able to choose the ones he/she is truly interested in attending. 

In the following stage, the organizers have access to the number of interested people for each lecture and plan the schedule or group lectures with similar topics.

Once the schedule is closed, the attendee has access to a schedule with the lectures he/she previously chose.
